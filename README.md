#  Web Phishing Detection
##  Project Objective

- Preprocess and clean data using appropriate techniques.
- Apply classification algorithms to identify phishing websites.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics.
- Build a web application using Flask for live phishing URL detection.

##  Problem Statement

Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Our solution aims to:

- Detect phishing websites with high accuracy.
- Reduce false negatives and improve reliability.
- Develop a system that is scalable, user-friendly, and secure.

##  Proposed Solution

An intelligent and flexible web phishing detection system using:
- Address bar-based features
- HTML and JavaScript-based features
- Domain-based features

Machine learning models like:
- KNN
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- SVM

### Key Features Extracted
- URL length, use of IP address, redirection
- Abnormal behaviors in meta tags or forms
- Use of JavaScript tricks (e.g., disabling right-click)
- Domain age, DNS record availability, Google indexing

## Testing

Manual and automated tests were conducted to validate:
- UI responsiveness
- Feature extraction and ML prediction accuracy
- Classification of URLs as legitimate or phishing
